2. Click the **"Generate Report"** button.
3. The Excel file will be automatically generated and downloaded to your device.

### Example JSON Data

Here is an example of how the JSON data should be structured to generate a report:

```json
[
  {
    "ID": 1,
    "Customer Name": "Alice",
    "Customer who called on WhatsApp": "Jo√£o",
    "Company Name": "Company A",
    "Customer Query": "Product X",
    "Call Time": "10:00",
    "Average Response Time": "15 minutes",
    "Date": "2024-05-20",
    "Day: .. Service of the Day": "Monday"
  },
  {
    "ID": 2,
    "Customer Name": "Bob",
    "Customer who called on WhatsApp": "Maria",
    "Company Name": "Company B",
    "Customer Query": "Service Y",
    "Call Time": "11:30",
    "Average Response Time": "20 minutes",
    "Date": "2024-05-20",
    "Day: .. Service of the Day": "Monday"
  },
  {
    "ID": 3,
    "Customer Name": "Charlie",
    "Customer who called on WhatsApp": "Pedro",
    "Company Name": "Company C",
    "Customer Query": "Product Z",
    "Call Time": "14:45",
    "Average Response Time": "10 minutes",
    "Date": "2024-05-21",
    "Day: .. Service of the Day": "Tuesday"
  }
]
```

## Future Improvements

- **Support for More Formats**: Implement support for importing and exporting other data formats (CSV, XML, etc.).
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization to control access to reports.
- **Data Analysis**: Add features for data analysis and visualization with charts and dynamic reports.
